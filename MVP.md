## Finding the busiest subway stations in New York by using MTA data. 

As our final goal, we are trying to help the WomenTechWomenYes organization gather the most signatures and emails from people that would
attend their Gala and could also contribute to their cause. 

Our first approach has been analyzing the data from the MTA to find which are the busiest subway stations in the city,
to increase the possibilities of getting people to sign up for the event. 

We can see in the image below the top 10 of the subway stations sorted by their traffic.

Future steps include a more granular analysis of the top stations and ideally do some study of the demographics around the areas 
of higher traffic.
